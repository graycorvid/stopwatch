# STOPWATCH
Project for practicing setInterval() and using Sass. 


## Description:
Simple stopwatch design.** 
```
You can start and pause the stopwatch. 
There is an option to save up to 10 timestamps that will be displayed on the bottom right. 

Reset restarts (00:00:00) the stopwatch. 
Clear deletes currently displayed timestamps. 
```

***right now the only display that is properly styled is the small, portrait mode for mobiles*
